Question 2
Ben and Alyssa are working on a vehicle management system. So far, they have created classes called Auto and Motorcycle to represent automobiles and motorcycles. After having noticed common information and calculations they were performing for each type of vehicle, they decided to break out the commonality into a separate class called WheeledVehicle. This is what their code looks like so far:

Copy Code
class WheeledVehicle
  attr_accessor :speed, :heading

  def initialize(tire_array, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    @tires = tire_array
    @fuel_efficiency = km_traveled_per_liter
    @fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity
  end

  def tire_pressure(tire_index)
    @tires[tire_index]
  end

  def inflate_tire(tire_index, pressure)
    @tires[tire_index] = pressure
  end

  def range
    @fuel_capacity * @fuel_efficiency
  end
end

class Auto < WheeledVehicle
  def initialize
    # 4 tires are various tire pressures
    super([30,30,32,32], 50, 25.0)
  end
end

class Motorcycle < WheeledVehicle
  def initialize
    # 2 tires are various tire pressures
    super([20,20], 80, 8.0)
  end
end
Now Alan has asked them to incorporate a new type of vehicle into their system - a Catamaran defined as follows:

Copy Code
class Catamaran
  attr_reader :propeller_count, :hull_count
  attr_accessor :speed, :heading

  def initialize(num_propellers, num_hulls, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    # ... code omitted ...
  end
end
This new class does not fit well with the object hierarchy defined so far. Catamarans don/t have tires. But we still want common code to track fuel efficiency and range. Modify the class definitions and move code into a Module, as necessary, to share code among the Catamaran and the wheeled vehicles.





Solution 2 ########

We can move anything shared with the catamaran and wheeled vehicles into a new module (let/s call Moveable) that we include in both individual classes.

Also, in the initializers of the classes that include the Moveable module, we must reference the setter methods that have been defined in Moveable (the fuel capacity and efficiency) using self. notation. Otherwise, this would be interpreted as setting local variables that will lose their scope as soon as the initializers return.

Copy Code
module Moveable
  attr_accessor :speed, :heading
  attr_writer :fuel_capacity, :fuel_efficiency

  def range
    @fuel_capacity * @fuel_efficiency
  end
end

class WheeledVehicle
  include Moveable

  def initialize(tire_array, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    @tires = tire_array
    self.fuel_efficiency = km_traveled_per_liter
    self.fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity
  end

  def tire_pressure(tire_index)
    @tires[tire_index]
  end

  def inflate_tire(tire_index, pressure)
    @tires[tire_index] = pressure
  end
end

class Catamaran
  include Moveable

  attr_reader :propeller_count, :hull_count

  def initialize(num_propellers, num_hulls, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    self.fuel_efficiency = km_traveled_per_liter
    self.fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity

    # ... other code to track catamaran-specific data omitted ...
  end
end
The definitions of Auto and Motorcycle can remain unchanged, since they both inherit from WheeledVehicle and we/ve moved any code shared between Catamaran and WheeledVehicles to the Moveable module.
