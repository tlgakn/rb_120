Practice Problems: Hard 1
Question 1
Alyssa has been assigned a task of modifying a class that was initially created to keep track of secret information. The new requirement calls for adding logging, when clients of the class attempt to access the secret data. Here is the class in its current form:

Copy Code
class SecretFile
  attr_reader :data

  def initialize(secret_data)
    @data = secret_data
  end
end
She needs to modify it so that any access to data must result in a log entry being generated. That is, any call to the class which will result in data being returned must first call a logging class. The logging class has been supplied to Alyssa and looks like the following:

Copy Code
class SecurityLogger
  def create_log_entry
    # ... implementation omitted ...
  end
end
Hint: Assume that you can modify the initialize method in SecretFile to have an instance of SecurityLogger be passed in as an additional argument. It may be helpful to review the lecture on collaborator objects for this practice problem.


Solution 1 ######
First modify the initialize method to take a SecurityLogger object as an argument and assign it to another instance variable.

Copy Code
class SecretFile
  attr_reader :data

  def initialize(secret_data, logger)
    @data = secret_data
    @logger = logger
  end
end
Second, Alyssa needs to remove the attr_reader and replace it with an explicit implementation of a method that returns the data instance variable. In that new method, she can add a call to the security logger.

Copy Code
class SecretFile
  def initialize(secret_data, logger)
    @data = secret_data
    @logger = logger
  end

  def data
    @logger.create_log_entry
    @data
  end
end
