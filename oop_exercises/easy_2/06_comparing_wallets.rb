# Comparing Wallets
# Consider the following broken code:

class Wallet
  include Comparable

  def initialize(amount)
    @amount = amount
  end

  def <=>(other_wallet)
    amount <=> other_wallet.amount
  end
end

bills_wallet = Wallet.new(500)
pennys_wallet = Wallet.new(465)

if bills_wallet > pennys_wallet
  puts 'Bill has more money than Penny'
elsif bills_wallet < pennys_wallet
  puts 'Penny has more money than Bill'
else
  puts 'Bill and Penny have the same amount of money.'
end

#Modify this code so it works. Do not make the amount in the wallet accessible to any method that isn't part of the Wallet class.

Solution
class Wallet
  ...

  protected

  attr_reader :amount
end

Discussion
# From the definition of the <=> method, we can see that the current wallet object must be able to call the amount getter both in its own context, and in the context of other_wallet. The easiest way to do this is to simply provide a public getter method for :amount.

# However, the problem description prevents this; nobody should be able to look at the amount except another wallet. To do this, we use the Module#protected method. A protected method is similar to a private method, except that methods of the class can call the protected method of any other object of the same class. Thus, bills_wallet can look at pennys_wallet to find the amount.

Further Exploration
# This example is rather contrived and unrealistic, but this type of situation occurs frequently in applications. Can you think of any applications where protected methods would be desirable?
