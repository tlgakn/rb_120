# Reverse Engineering
# Write a class that will display:
ABC
xyz

# when the following code is run:
my_data = Transform.new('abc')
puts my_data.uppercase
puts Transform.lowercase('XYZ')

Solution
Copy Code
class Transform
  def initialize(data)
    @data = data
  end

  def uppercase
    @data.upcase
  end

  def self.lowercase(str)
    str.downcase
  end
end

Discussion
# This problem is about distinguishing between instance and class methods.

# The first line of the test code creates an object from the Transform class, using a single string argument whose value is 'abc'. We then call the instance method, uppercase, using the my_data object as the caller. This returns the value we were passed during initialization in uppercase, which we then print.

# Finally, we call the class method lowercase, passing it a value of XYZ. lowercase converts its argument to lowercase and returns the result, which we then print.

# The solution simply implements the necessary class and methods so the test code runs and produces the desired result.

# Obviously, we need a Transform class, and, since we are calling new with an argument, we also need an initialize method that takes that argument and stashes it away in an instance variable. We also define uppercase to simply return the value of that instance variable in uppercase.

# We also need the class method lowercase. Since this is a class method, we must prefix the method name with self. Unlike uppercase, lowercase must obtain the string to convert from some source other than an instance variable; class methods do not have access to instance variables. Our test code uses an argument, so our method is implemented as one that takes an argument. The method then returns the value of the argument after converting it to lowercase.

Further Exploration
# A class method is also, somewhat confusingly, called a "singleton method" (the term is used in other contexts as well). We don't recommend learning the details at this time - it may be more confusing than it is helpful - but you should be aware that you may encounter this term.
