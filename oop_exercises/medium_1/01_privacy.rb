Privacy
Consider the following class:

Copy Code
class Machine
  attr_writer :switch

  def start
    self.flip_switch(:on)
  end

  def stop
    self.flip_switch(:off)
  end

  def flip_switch(desired_state)
    self.switch = desired_state
  end
end
Modify this class so both flip_switch and the setter method switch= are private methods.


Solution
Copy Code
class Machine
  def start
    flip_switch(:on)     # self.flip_switch(:on) is okay in Ruby 2.7 or higher
  end

  def stop
    flip_switch(:off)    # self.flip_switch(:off) is okay in Ruby 2.7 or higher
  end

  private

  attr_writer :switch

  def flip_switch(desired_state)
    self.switch = desired_state
  end
end
Discussion
This problem is slightly trickier than it seems at first glance.

We dont want to expose certain methods to the users of this code. Those two methods are flip_switch and the setter for @switch (as attr_writer :switch). To accomplish this task, lets make both flip_switch and attr_writer :switch private methods; that way, they can only be called from within the Machine class.

The easy part is converting flip_switch to a private method. To do this, all we need to do is add a call to the Module#private in the class body prior to the definition of flip_switch, and we also need to remove the self. callers from the two calls to flip_switch (the caller is not necessary but is accepted when flip_switch is public, but it is prohibited when flip_switch is private).

As of Ruby 2.7, it is now acceptable to call a private method with self, e.g., self.flip_switch.

Where things get tricky is making the setter for switch private. The easy part is to simply move the attr_writer call for switch into the private section of the class definition. The trickier part is the call to the setter method: unlike all other private method calls, you must specify the caller when calling a setter method. If you try to remove the caller, ruby will create a local variable named switch.

Now that we have our attr_writer and the flip_switch as private methods, the only way to set the instance variable @switch is through start and stop methods.

Further Exploration
Add a private getter for @switch to the Machine class, and add a method to Machine that shows how to use that getter.
