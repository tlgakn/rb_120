You/ve Got Mail!
Can you decipher and fix the error that the following code produces?

Copy Code
class Mail
  def to_s
    "#{self.class}"
  end
end

class Email < Mail
  attr_accessor :subject, :body

  def initialize(subject, body)
    @subject = subject
    @body = body
  end
end

class Postcard < Mail
  attr_reader :text

  def initialize(text)
    @text = text
  end
end

module Mailing
  def receive(mail, sender)
    mailbox << mail unless reject?(sender)
  end

  # Change if there are sources you want to block.
  def reject?(sender)
    false
  end

  def send(destination, mail)
    "Sending #{mail} from #{name} to: #{destination}"
    # Omitting the actual sending.
  end
end

class CommunicationsProvider
  attr_reader :name, :account_number

  def initialize(name, account_number=nil)
    @name = name
    @account_number = account_number
  end
end

class EmailService < CommunicationsProvider
  include Mailing

  attr_accessor :email_address, :mailbox

  def initialize(name, account_number, email_address)
    super(name, account_number)
    @email_address = email_address
    @mailbox = []
  end

  def empty_inbox
    self.mailbox = []
  end
end

class TelephoneService < CommunicationsProvider
  def initialize(name, account_number, phone_number)
    super(name, account_number)
    @phone_number = phone_number
  end
end

class PostalService < CommunicationsProvider
  attr_accessor :street_address, :mailbox

  def initialize(name, street_address)
    super(name)
    @street_address = street_address
    @mailbox = []
  end

  def change_address(new_address)
    self.street_address = new_address
  end
end

rafaels_email_account = EmailService.new('Rafael', 111, 'Rafael@example.com')
johns_phone_service   = TelephoneService.new('John', 122, '555-232-1121')
johns_postal_service  = PostalService.new('John', '47 Sunshine Ave.')
ellens_postal_service = PostalService.new('Ellen', '860 Blackbird Ln.')

puts johns_postal_service.send(ellens_postal_service.street_address, Postcard.new('Greetings from Silicon Valley!'))
# => undefined method `860 Blackbird Ln.' for #<PostalService:0x00005571b4aaebe8> (NoMethodError)



Solution
Copy Code
module Mailing
  def receive(mail, sender)
    mailbox << mail unless reject?(sender)
  end

  # Change if there are sources you want to block.
  def reject?(sender)
    false
  end

  def send_mail(destination, mail)
    "Sending #{mail} from #{name} to: #{destination}"
    # Omitting the actual sending.
  end
end

class PostalService < CommunicationsProvider
  include Mailing

  # code omitted
end

puts johns_postal_service.send_mail(ellens_postal_service.street_address, Postcard.new('Greetings from Silicon Valley!'))
#=> Sending Postcard from John to: 860 Blackbird Ln.
Discussion
This is a case of accidental method overriding.

On line 91, we intended to call Mailing#send, but since we forgot to include Mailing in PostalService, this does not happen. Why does Ruby not complain that there is no method send? First it looks for send on the method lookup path, and it actually finds a method with this name in the Object class. So it calls Object#send, which expects a method name as the first argument. Since the first argument we provide, '860 Blackbird Ln.', is not the name of any method, we get an error.

In order to avoid overriding Object#send, we should rename our Mailing#send method to something unique, as seen in the solution above.

You may wish to review the chapter on Accidental Method Overriding in Launch School's Object Oriented Programming book. Note that you don't need to memorize the Object#send method, or try to keep in mind all other methods that Object implements. Just be aware that you may encounter code like this in the wild and take caution not to accidentally override built-in methods.
