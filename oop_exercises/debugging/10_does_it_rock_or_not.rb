Does it Rock or Not?
We discovered Gary Bernhardt/s repository for finding out whether something rocks or not, and decided to adapt it for a simple example.

Copy Code
class AuthenticationError < Exception; end

# A mock search engine
# that returns a random number instead of an actual count.
class SearchEngine
  def self.count(query, api_key)
    unless valid?(api_key)
      raise AuthenticationError, 'API key is not valid.'
    end

    rand(200_000)
  end

  private

  def self.valid?(key)
    key == 'LS1A'
  end
end

module DoesItRock
  API_KEY = 'LS1A'

  class NoScore; end

  class Score
    def self.for_term(term)
      positive = SearchEngine.count(%{"#{term} rocks"}, API_KEY).to_f
      negative = SearchEngine.count(%{"#{term} is not fun"}, API_KEY).to_f

      positive / (positive + negative)
    rescue Exception
      NoScore
    end
  end

  def self.find_out(term)
    score = Score.for_term(term)

    case score
    when NoScore
      "No idea about #{term}..."
    when 0...0.5
      "#{term} is not fun."
    when 0.5
      "#{term} seems to be ok..."
    else
      "#{term} rocks!"
    end
  rescue Exception => e
    e.message
  end
end

# Example (your output may differ)

puts DoesItRock.find_out('Sushi')       # Sushi seems to be ok...
puts DoesItRock.find_out('Rain')        # Rain is not fun.
puts DoesItRock.find_out('Bug hunting') # Bug hunting rocks!
In order to test the case when authentication fails, we can simply set API_KEY to any string other than the correct key. Now, when using a wrong API key, we want our mock search engine to raise an AuthenticationError, and we want the find_out method to catch this error and print its error message API key is not valid.

Is this what you expect to happen given the code?

And why do we always get the following output instead?

Copy Code
Sushi rocks!
Rain rocks!
Bug hunting rocks!


Approach/Algorithm
The unintended behavior of our code is caused by two independent issues:

The AuthenticationError is raised, but the Score::for_term method catches it, so it never reaches the DoesItRock::find_out method.
When the return value of Score::for_term is NoScore, the case statement in DoesItRock::find_out does not behave as expected.
In addition, we inherit from and rescue Exceptions. This does not influence the behavior of our code directly, but it is highly discouraged.

We will look at each of these issues in detail in the Discussion section.



Solution
Copy Code
class AuthenticationError < StandardError; end

# A fake search engine
# code omitted

module DoesItRock
  API_KEY = 'wrong key'

  class NoScore; end

  class Score
    def self.for_term(term)
      positive = SearchEngine.count(%{"#{term} rocks"}, API_KEY).to_f
      negative = SearchEngine.count(%{"#{term} is not fun"}, API_KEY).to_f

      positive / (positive + negative)
    rescue ZeroDivisionError
      NoScore.new
    end
  end

  def self.find_out(term)
    score = Score.for_term(term)

    case score
    when NoScore
      "No idea about #{term}..."
    when 0...0.5
      "#{term} is not fun."
    when 0.5
      "#{term} seems to be ok..."
    else
      "#{term} rocks!"
    end
  rescue StandardError => e
    e.message
  end
end
Discussion
The SearchEngine indeed raises an AuthenticationError, but it never reaches the DoesItRock::find_out method, because Score::for_term already catches it, resulting in the return value NoScore.

But if the return value is NoScore, why does the find_out method not print the message "No idea about #{term}..."? In order to see this, recall how case statements work. The value of score will be compared with each value in the when clauses using the === operator. In case of the first when clause, the comparison is NoScore === score, and since the left-hand side is a class, its implementation boils down to checking whether score is_a? NoScore. This yields false when score has the value NoScore, as it is not an instance of the NoScore class. As a result, we end up with the value of the else clause.

In order to fix this, Score::for_term has to return an instance of the NoScore class (i.e. NoScore.new), instead of the name of the class itself.

Now, back to the original problem: if the API key is wrong, we want the AuthenticationError to reach the find_out method. One way to achieve this is to simply remove the rescue clause in Score::for_term. But this would also prevent us from rescuing other exceptions, like a possible ZeroDivisionError, which arguably is a perfect occasion to return no score. In order to solve this, we decide to rescue only that specific exception within Score::for_term and let all others through.

With those changes, the code runs as expected. However, there is still one thing wrong about our code, which is less obvious. And that's the use of Exception.

Exception is the top-most class in Ruby's exception hierarchy and it seems a straightforward choice to rescue or inherit from. But it's too broad. When creating custom exceptions and when rescuing exceptions, it's good practice to always use the subclass StandardError. StandardError subsumes all application-level errors. The other descendants of Exception are used for system- or environment-level errors, like memory overflows or program interruptions. These are the kind of errors your application usually does not want to throw - and definitely does not want to rescue, they should be handled by Ruby itself.

Further exploration
You may wish to review this blog article for a refresher on working with Ruby exceptions and the important difference between Exception and StandardError.

Finally, we shouldn't include sensitive information like API keys as plain text in our source code. The safest way to store them is using an environment variable (or a gem that simulates this). Don't worry about that now, though; just be aware of it.
