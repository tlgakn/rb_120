# Buggy Code - Car Mileage
# Fix the following code so it works properly:

class Car
  attr_accessor :mileage

  def initialize
    @mileage = 0
  end

  def increment_mileage(miles)
    total = mileage + miles
    mileage = total
  end

  def print_mileage
    puts mileage
  end
end

car = Car.new
car.mileage = 5000
car.increment_mileage(678)
car.print_mileage  # should print 5678

# Solution
# Solution 1: Change increment_mileage to:

# Copy Code
# def increment_mileage(miles)
#   total = mileage + miles
#   self.mileage = total
# end
# Solution 2: Change increment_mileage to:

# Copy Code
# def increment_mileage(miles)
#   total = mileage + miles
#   @mileage = total
# end
# Discussion
# The problem with this code is that we are attempting to use a setter method for the @mileage instance variable like this:

# Copy Code
# mileage = total
# All this manages to do is create a local variable named mileage. When we run the code, the output is thus 5000, not the expected 5678.

# To access the setter method, we need to provide an explicit caller:

# Copy Code
# self.mileage = total
# or refer to the instance variable directly:

# Copy Code
# @mileage = total
# Solution 2 bypasses the setter method entirely, which may not be what you want. It's generally safer to use an explicit self. caller when you have a setter method unless you have a good reason to use the instance variable directly. We say that calling the setter method, if available, is safer since using the instance variable bypasses any checks or operations performed by the setter. For instance, consider what would happen if our setter method looked like this:

# Copy Code
# def mileage=(miles)
#   @mileage = miles.to_i
# end
# When you use the setter method elsewhere in your class, you're guaranteed that it will try to apply #to_i to the value. If you don't use the setter, you may set the mileage to a string value.
